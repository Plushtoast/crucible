      condition: Struck in melee by a weapon made of metal.
      description: >-
        <p>When struck by a melee weapon made of metal, the ooze attempts to
        consume the weapon itself, potentially breaking it.</p><p>This attack is
        <strong>Harmless</strong>, but if successful the
        <strong>Quality</strong> of the weapon used in the attack is downgraded
        by one tier. On a Critical Success or if the weapon is already
        <strong>Shoddy</strong>, the weapon becomes entirely
        <strong>Broken</strong>. Enchanted weapons are protected against this
        effect.</p>
