    <p>Like your parents before you, you were born with the enduring fortitude
    of the Dwarves. Your stout stature and burly physical appearance are the
    hallmarks of a people born of earth and stone. A legacy of physical
    resilience is yours to inherit, for in your breast beats a heart of
    stone.</p>
