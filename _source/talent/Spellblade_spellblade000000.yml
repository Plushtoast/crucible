    on both martial and arcane techniques in battle. The physical strikes of
    your weaponry partially substitute for the somatic gestures of traditional
    spellcraft.</p><p>While wielding a <strong>Melee</strong> weapon as your
    mainhand weapon, spells you cast using <strong>Gesture: Strike</strong>
    benefit from your weapon's damage bonus.</p><p>Immediately after performing
    a <strong>Strike</strong> with a melee weapon, you may cast a spell with its
    <strong>Action</strong> cost reduced by 1.</p>
