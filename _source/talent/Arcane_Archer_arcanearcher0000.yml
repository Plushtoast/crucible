  description: >-
    <p>Your skill with archery can shape your spellcraft, partially substituting
    for the somatic gestures of traditional spellcasting.</p><p>While using a
    <strong>Projectile </strong>weapon as your mainhand weapon, you ignore the
    free-hand requirement for casting spells using the <strong>Arrow</strong>
    gesture and the range of those spells becomes your weapon
    range.</p><p>Immediately after performing a <strong>Strike</strong> with a
    projectile weapon, you may cast a spell with its <strong>Action</strong>
    cost reduced by 1.</p>
